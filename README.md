# Želim posao! 👨‍💼

👨‍💼 **Želim posao!** (_I want a job!_) is a simple app made in **Flutter**.

#### I created it for two reasons:

1. I wanted to work more with **Flutter**.
2. I'm searching for a job so I wanted to automate the process.

#### How does it work? 👷‍♂️

1.  The app scrapes the sites of the companies I sympathise and would love to work at.
2.  It finds the job titles and stores them in a _Map_ of a particular company.
3.  It filters those _Maps_ in order to show the information desired by the user.

**User can search by keyword or see all jobs from desired company.**

## Things I still want to do 👨‍💻

- [ ] Put some text in the loading screen, showing the user that the jobs are getting fetched.
- [ ] Create screenshots of the app.
- [ ] Create an icon & splash screen for the app.
- [ ] Implement **InfoScreen**.
- [ ] Make the Header fixed - It shouldn't be scrollable.
- [ ] Make the **Categories** reflect the jobs without bundling everything in **home_page.dart**.
- [ ] Refactor **search_results.dart** & **category_results.dart**.
- [ ] Remove _hidden jobs_ from **UHP Digital**.
- [x] Write comments explaining various procedures.
- [x] Implement some graphic when the screen is empty (on start & when there are no jobs).
